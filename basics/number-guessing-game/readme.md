# Number Guessing Game

This is a small Python project I made while practicing basic concepts.

The program generates a random number between 1 and 100 and the user has to guess it.  
After each guess, it tells whether the number is too high or too low until the correct number is guessed.

## Concepts used
- random module
- functions
- while loop
- if-else conditions
- try and except for invalid input

## How to play
Run the file and enter a number between 1 and 100 when asked.  
Keep guessing until you get the correct number
