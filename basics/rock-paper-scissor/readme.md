# Rock Paper Scissors

A simple Rock Paper Scissors game made using Python.

The user plays against the computer by choosing rock, paper, or scissors.  
The computer randomly selects its choice and the result is displayed.

## Concepts used
- random module
- functions
- while loops
- input validation
- if-elif-else conditions

## Controls
- r → Rock  
- p → Paper  
- s → Scissors  

This project helped me practice writing cleaner functions and handling user input properly.
