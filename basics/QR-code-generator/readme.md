# QR Code Generator

A simple Python program that generates a QR code from user input.

The user can enter any text or URL and the program creates a QR code image file using the `qrcode` library.

I built this project to practice working with external libraries and file generation in Python.

## Features
- Takes text or URL as input
- Allows custom file name
- Generates a QR code image
- Custom color styling (red QR)

## Concepts Used
- Third-party Python libraries
- User input handling
- File saving
- Basic program structure
